    This link was already requested, you may have overlooked it. Please scroll in link requests or try keywords or title in the search bar. You may get lucky and it’s already found — or you click follow when you find the earlier post and we’re all fine.

  missing_title_template: >
    Your post has been removed because it doesn't include the drama name or a short description in the header. This is required to keep the subreddit organized and help others find and fulfill similar requests.
    If the name is visible on the poster, just add it to the header.
    If there’s no name, please add a short description instead. Think of what caught your attention, add the genre, storyline, actor’s name, or a brief summary of what you saw in the ad.
    Why do we ask this? Because search terms like “link” or “Do you know the title?” aren’t helpful for others looking for the same drama.
